This simple mod for Civilization 6 adds some new hotkeys.
This mod does not affect saved games (you can use it with old saves)!
All hotkeys can be reassigned in the game settings.

New hotkeys:

If you need a hotkey for some action, let me know in the comments, I'll try to add it when I have time.
And let me know if you have any ideas what other actions can be combined with [b] existing [/b] hotkeys.
Some actions can only be performed on certain units, so, it is safe to bind them into the one hotkey. Such as "pillage the hex" / "repair the hex". Because a worker can't pillage and a warrior can't restore. So, such actions will never appear together.

[b]If you have any errors:[/b]
1. Please, try to reproduce the bug [b]multiple times[/b] and find out under what conditions the bug appears.
2. Provide the content of the [i]%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\Logs\Database.log[/i] file in the comments.
