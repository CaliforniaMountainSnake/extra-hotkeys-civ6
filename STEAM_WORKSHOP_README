This simple mod for Civilization 6 adds some new hotkeys.
This mod does not affect saved games (you can use it with old saves)!
All hotkeys can be reassigned in the game settings.

New hotkeys:

If you need a hotkey for some action, let me know in the comments, I'll try to add it when I have time.
